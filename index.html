She’s one of the most passionate individuals I’ve ever had the privilege to meet as a friend or have as a business associate. Anyone lucky enough to cross her path will surely agree: Teri brings 110% of her fire and zeal to the table on any given project. She’s a powerhouse and a great companion and compatriot to have in your corner.” - Margaret Dempsey</blockquote>

			<article id = "abouttext1">Greetings. I am a devoted tech divinity who was ‘born on the Internet’ - a freelance UX|UI designer, web developer and a former digital marketing entrepreneur. I am the technomancer.

			My youth was spent immersed in the new technologies in front of me until nerdy computer habits became a clear path to a career. After many years successfully running my own digital marketing company, I developed an affinity for user experience design and the sophisticated way it blends art, culture, science, technology and people. I adjusted my self-made path to begin my formal education at <a href="https://generalassemb.ly/">General Assembly</a> where I completed the UXDI program in February 2018 and graduate the WDI program in July 2018 after a rekindling of my love of code. I spend my time freelancing, consulting and pursuing my passion projects along the way.</article>
